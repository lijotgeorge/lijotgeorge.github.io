                <div class="post-content">
                    <p>In the previous post I mentioned how I had skipped one lesson in the course before jumping into the <a href="https://lijotgeorge.github.io/posts/20210907152633-etch-a-sketch.md/">Etch-a-Sketch</a> project. Well it turns out I missed on a lot more than just learning about DOM maniupulation. There was a project to make a UI version of a simple rock-paper-scissors game taught earlier in the JavaScript course as well.</p>
<p>The earlier version was mainly to teach and get people familiar with the browser console and everything was printed there. It wasn&rsquo;t all that hard for me then but making the UI had me pulling my hair for a good minute.</p>
<p>First, the demo of the project is <a href="https://lijotgeorge.github.io/rock-paper-scissors/">here</a> and the opening page is below.</p>
<p><img src="/rock-paper-scissors.png" alt="Bear-Hunter-Ninja"></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not quite obvious from the image but I wanted to go for a &ldquo;Street-Fighter&rdquo;-esque look for the game. Don&rsquo;t think I quite succeeded with that but whatever. In implementation the task was to compare the choice made by the user with that of the &ldquo;computer&rdquo; which was just a random pick of the three choices. In the non-UI version the player choice was done using a prompt at the beginning of every round and the program would compare the two and decide on the winner based on the appropriate conditions.</p>
<p>For the UI, I had to overhaul basically everything. The only thing that remained was the function that decided the winner given the two choices. In this project as well there was a particular JS concept that was causing me a lot of trouble that I had to rely once again to the Discord users for help. The main thing I took away from the exercise was learning how to better use <code>eventListeners</code>. I have a slightly better understanding of the concept and hopefully that will help me out in my next projects. I know for sure if I had done this before the Etch-a-Sketch challenge I would not have had that hard of a time. Ah well, lessons learned I suppose.</p>
